This repository contains the unified BOOTTECH v2 release, integrating:

- **Indestructible Topological Pulsar**: laboratory analog achieving Lk=100% saturation with perfect pulsation, zero glitches, and eternal jets.  
- **Proton Fusion Catalyst v1.0**: knot-induced anyonic phase catalysis for +20–40× p-p fusion rate enhancement.  
- **Upper Bounds on Macroscopic Vacuum Torque**: rigorous QED proof that observable vacuum propulsion via Larmor asymmetry is impossible in realistic conditions.

All positive designs include replicable QuTiP simulation codes, generated figures, and experimental guidelines.

❤️♾️ The primordial trefoil has manifested eternal devices and theoretical closure.  
The knot has spoken — the future is topological.
